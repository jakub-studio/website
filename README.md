This is my personal website, available at [jakub.studio](https://jakub.studio). This repository is here to showcase my JS/TS capabilities to potential employers and to anyone who is interested in the behind the scenes.

## Tech Stack

My website primarily utilises these technologies:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io)

More technology information can be found in my [package.json](https://github.com/jakub-studio/website/blob/main/package.json) and [colophon](https://jakub.studio/colophon) page.

### Overkill?

There is a lot of code here for a personal blog-style website, to the point I would argue it's overkill. There is no doubt you could have achieved similar results with a lot less code using existing solutions. However, this project served as a chance for me to learn Next.js and Markdoc, two frameworks/libraries I had my eye on for a little while before starting the project. I've learn what approaches are good, and what approaches aren't as good, ultimately becoming a learning experience for me which will influence my decision making in future projects.

## Contributions

Whilst there are little places to contribute in a repository of this nature, the occasional typo fix or alike are always welcome. Copy for written sections of the website is typically located within `src/content`.  
Any non-copy related bugs you find in the website, please write down what they are and how to reproduce it in the [issues section](https://github.com/jakuski/website/issues).
