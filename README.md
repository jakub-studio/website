This is my personal website, available at [jakub.studio](https://jakub.studio). This repository is here to showcase my JS/TS capabilities to potential employers and to anyone who is interested in the behind the scenes.

## Tech Stack
My website primarily utilises these technologies:
- [React.js]()
- [Next.js]()
- [TailwindCSS]()
- [Markdoc]()

More technology information can be find in my [package.json]() and [colophon](https://jakub.studio/colophon) page.

## Contributions
Whilst there are little places to contribute in a repository of this nature, the occasional typo fix or alike are always welcome.
