This is my personal website, available at [jakub.studio](https://jakub.studio). This repository is here to showcase my JS/TS capabilities to potential employers and to anyone who is interested in the behind the scenes.

## Tech Stack
My website primarily utilises these technologies:
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io)

More technology information can be found in my [package.json]() and [colophon](https://jakub.studio/colophon) page.

### Overkill?
There is a lot of code here for a personal blog-style website, to the point I would argue it's overkill. There is no doubt you could have achieved similar results with a lot less code using services such as WordPress or alike. However, this project served as a chance for me to learn Next.js and Markdoc, two frameworks/libraries I had my eye on for a little while before starting the project. I've learn what approaches are good, and what approaches aren't as great which will influence my future projects.

## Contributions
Whilst there are little places to contribute in a repository of this nature, the occasional typo fix or alike are always welcome. Any bugs you find in the website, please write down what they are and how to reproduce it in the [issues section](https://github.com/jakuski/website/issues).
