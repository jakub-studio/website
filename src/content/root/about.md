{% image src="g/figma-london" /%}
A digital designer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional and intuitive user experiences, putting thought and care into every last detail. I come from a Graphic Design degree but have focused on UI and UX design. I've also been a self-taught developer since 2018. Primarily learning and working within the JavaScript ecosystem. I have a strong understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and have also worked with Node.js, React, TypeScript, Electron, Express, Next.js, TailwindCSS and many more. Recently, I've been learning Rust and Apple's Swift (+ SwiftUI).

At my core, I'm a problem solver. I love to learn and I love to create. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. 

### Experience
I've previously done a placement at [The One Off](http://theoneoff.com). Here, I worked on a conceptual digital way-finding experience for [FLANNELS Liverpool](https://www.flannels.com/liverpool-flagshp-fl-store-2781), in-store experiences for [Sports Direct](http://www.sportsdirect.com/) and some concepting/ideation work for other international clients.  
*The work mentioned cannot be shown publicly, but please [contact me](/contact) if you would like to find out more.*

### Currently
I'm on the [Flipside programme](https://www.anewdirection.org.uk/programmes/flipside) which is run by [A New Direction](https://anewdirection.org.uk/). An industry-led programme helping people kickstart their careers in digital product design. I'm being taught by some of the best-in-the-business, [ustwo](https://ustwo.com/), [Made by Many](https://madebymany.com/), [Bynd](https://bynd.com/), [Frog](https://www.frog.co/), [Digitas](https://www.digitas.com/en-gb/) and [Normally](https://normally.com/). 

### Work
I'm also looking for a role (part-time until end of March, full-time after that) as a UI/UX designer or front-end developer. I'm open to remote work but would prefer a London-based hybrid/in-person role.  
Please [contact me](/contact) if you would like to get in touch.

### Outside of design
When I'm not in Figma or Visual Studio Code, I enjoy(-*mostly*) working on my car, buying tools I definitely do not need but absolutely want or spinning something up in the kitchen. I'm a massive foodie and love trying new recipes and techniques. I also enjoy a nice tea, preferably loose leaf. I'm a bit of a tea snob.

### Future Ambitions
If the opportunity arose, I would love to work in San Francisco for a few years. It's the heart of the tech industry and I would love to give it a go and see the culture in-person.  
Later on, I aim of starting my own studio later down the line, delivering beautifully crafted bespoke websites and applications to clients who want to be ahead of the game. I've also had a few ideas for some SaaS products that I'd like to develop and release in the future.  
See you at my funding round. ðŸ‘‹
