**Bio**

Hey, I'm Jakub. A UI/UX focused-designer and diehard perfectionist who's margin for error is practically nil. As a result, I often spend a lot of time refining small details in my designs, to which people tell me "Nobody will notice that!", however I don't listen to them. I believe it's the small details that matter. Those details are what put the user experience above and beyond other designs/applications. I also highly enjoy learning new skills/techniques/software that I can use to push my designs above and beyond. Apart from design, I enjoy cooking, working on cars and coding.

**Future Ambitions**

I aim of starting my own studio later down the line, delivering beautifully crafted bespoke websites and applications to clients who want to be ahead of the game. After all, we take our first bite with our eyes.
