Hey, I'm Jakub. A UI/UX focused-designer and diehard perfectionist who's margin for error is practically nil.
As a result, I often spend a lot of time refining small details in my designs, to which people tell me "Nobody will notice that!", however I don't listen to them. I believe it's the small details that matter. Those details are what put the user experience above and beyond other designs/applications. I also highly enjoy learning new skills/techniques/software that I can use to push my designs above and beyond.

### Experience
I've previously done a placement at [The One Off](http://theoneoff.com). Here, I worked on a conceptual digital way-finding experience for [FLANNELS Liverpool](https://www.flannels.com/liverpool-flagshp-fl-store-2781), in-store experiences for [Sports Direct](http://www.sportsdirect.com/) and some concepting/ideation work for other international clients.  
*The work mentioned cannot be shown publicly, please [contact me](/contact) if you would like to find out more.*

### Outside of design
When I'm not in Figma or Visual Studio Code, I enjoy(-*mostly*) working on my car, buying tools I definitely do not need but absolutely want or spinning something up in the kitchen. I'm a massive foodie and love trying new recipes and techniques. I also enjoy a nice tea, preferably loose leaf. I'm a bit of a tea snob.

### Future Ambitions
If the opportunity arose, I would love to work in San Francisco for a few years. It's the heart of the tech industry and I would love to give it a go and see the culture in-person.  
Later on, I aim of starting my own studio later down the line, delivering beautifully crafted bespoke websites and applications to clients who want to be ahead of the game. I've also had a few ideas for some SaaS products that I'd like to develop and release in the future.  
See you at my funding round. ðŸ‘‹
