screwd was created out of my love for DIY. Whilst I can't quite say I'm a master of making, I'm thrilled by the process and learning how to do stuff myself.

The brief for this project was to explore the magnificence within the mundane. I can't quite remember how I decided to look into screws, but here we are.

The app is a conceptual AR scanner for screws (think [PlantApp](https://plantapp.app/) but for screws). It allows you to scan a screw, find out various information about it (such as drive, lengths), what it's used for and links to buy it. It's primary target markets are DIYers and tradespeople.

The last image is a poster of different screw drives I came across during my research for this project. I thought a poster of all the different drives would be a great addition to any workshop so I made this one. There are still a few rare drives missing, but I'll add them in soon and distribute the poster as a PDF.
