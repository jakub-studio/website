screwd was created out of my love for DIY. Whilst I can't quite say I'm a master of making, I'm thrilled by the process and learning how to do stuff myself.

The brief for this project was to explore the magnificence within the mundane. I can't quite remember how I decided to look into screws, but here we are.

The app is a conceptual AR scanner for screws (think [PlantApp](https://plantapp.app/) but for screws). It allows you to scan a screw, find out various information about it (such as drive, lengths), what it's used for and links to buy it. It's primary target markets are DIYers and tradespeople.
