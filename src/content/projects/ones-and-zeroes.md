ones & zeroes is digital platform to a response to a crisis currently growing in the UK. The next generation coming into the workforce, Generation Z and Alpha soon enough, are not being given the skills they need to succeed in employment within a digital world. They are struggling with skills that most currently in a digital role take for granted/think nothing of. This is a problem that is only going to get worse as the world becomes more and more digital. There are a number of reasons for this, but the main one is that the education system is not keeping up with the pace of change. The curriculum is not being updated to reflect the skills that are needed in the modern world, and the topics that are taught, are not relevant to what a person might do.

## Flipside '23 {% #flipside-information %}

This project was done as part of the {% link href=$links.flipside newWindow=true %}Flipside 2023 programme{% /link %}. The programme aims to get young Londoners into the digital product industry. It's a training programme which lasted 9 weeks for the '23 cohort. The programme was run by {% link href=$links.aNewDirection newWindow=true %}A New Direction{% /link %} and was taught by the following studios:

- [Made by Many](https://madebymany.com/)
- [Frog](https://www.frog.co/)
- [ustwo](https://ustwo.com/)
- [Normally](https://normally.com/)
- [Bynd](https://bynd.com/)
- [Digitas](https://www.digitas.com/en-gb/)

## Brief {% #brief %}

This brief was part of four briefs available for Flipside 2023. It was one of the more open briefs and had a lot of room for exploration. The brief was to create a digital product that would help the next generation of workers to succeed in a digital world. The final outcome could be an app, a website or product/service.

## Development {% #development %}

## Visual style {% #visual-style %}

The visual style of ones and zeroes is a breath of fresh air from the modernist [and most times, rather soul-less] interfaces of today.

Oh, and if this visual style had an anthem, only [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/05mAIVLkIWc2d1UBYZBCp8) song would do.

### Inspirations

The visual style of ones and zeroes is inspired by the following:

I've always been a huge fan of Figma's brand. Their brand studio have created such a brilliant aesthetic for what could be considered boring old design software.

### Style Kit

I built my own style kit (I don't call it a design system as I don't believe this is on that scale yet.) to ensure consistency within the app. It features a colour palette, custom hand-drawn pixel art icons, typographic styles, effect systems, a grid and a catalogue of interactive components to use.
