Spotify Post-Codes explores how Spotify can become more of a social platform. This project was done as part of the [D&AD New Blood Awards](https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-new-blood-awards/) 2021.

## The Brief {% #brief %}
The brief was set out by [Spotify.design](https://spotify.design/) in collaboration with [D&AD](https://www.dandad.org) as mentioned above. The main prompt behind the brief was the following:

> Get listeners to soundtrack and share their life through Spotify

My tutors got me to do a summarisation task which involved shortening the brief down to 16 words, then 8, then 4 and finally 2 words. I came up with the following answers:
- Create an experience within Spotify that allows users and artists to connect and share it.
- Get users and artists to connect within Spotify.
- Socialise the Spotify platform.
- Socialise Spotify.
