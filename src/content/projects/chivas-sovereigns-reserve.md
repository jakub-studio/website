Chivas Regal Sovereign's Reserve is the whisky for the next generation of "hustlers, dreamers, and doers". It's a classic whisky that's been redefined for a new generation, and I was tasked with creating a new visual identity for the brand. Done as part of the [D&AD New Blood Awards](https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-new-blood-awards/) 2022. This was an adventure into the unknown for me. Being my first packaging brief and first time working to produce photo-realistic 3D renders with [Redshift by Maxon](https://www.maxon.net/en/redshift). It was incredibly challenging but also incredibly rewarding. I'm very proud of the work I have produced and I hope you enjoy it too.
