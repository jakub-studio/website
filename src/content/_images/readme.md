# Compression

All bitmaps should be passed through https://squoosh.app/ before being added to the repository. This will ensure that the images are compressed as much as possible without losing quality. The default settings should be fine for most images, but if you want to tweak the settings, you can do so by clicking the "Advanced" button.
